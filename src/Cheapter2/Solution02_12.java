(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off speed v,
        you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the following formula:
        length = v2/2a
        Write a program that prompts the user to enter v
        in meters/second (m/s) and the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s2), and displays the minimum run- way length.
