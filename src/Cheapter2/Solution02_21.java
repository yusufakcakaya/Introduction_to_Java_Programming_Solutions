(Financial application: calculate future investment value) Write a program that reads in investment amount,
        annual interest rate, and number of years, and dis- plays the future investment value using the following formula:
        futureInvestmentValue = investmentAmount * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)numberOfYears*12
        For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, and number of years 1,
        the future investment value is 1032.98.
